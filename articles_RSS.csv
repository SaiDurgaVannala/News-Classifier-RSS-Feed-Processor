"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=bb&p=230716","Iraqi, Kurdish forces in standoff, weeks after Kurdish vote for independence","HARI SREENIVASAN: The desire of the Kurds along Iraq’s northern border to govern themselves is receiving more resistance from Iraq’s central government. Iraqi army forces are demanding Kurdish troops withdraw from oil fields and military bases around Kirkuk, a city in the Kurdistan region that voted for independence last month. Kirkuk also has 10% of Iraq’s known oil reserves. Washington Post’s Loveday Morris is in Baghdad covering this standoff joins me now via Skype. First of all the significance of this. Why is it so important?
LOVEDAY MORRIS: There’s been a longtime conflict between Baghdad and Kurdistan over these disputed territories. Most significant of which is Kirkuk because of the oil reserves. But the referendum last month has really sharpened these disputes because you have Baghdad opposing independence and so it feels like they have to restate its territorial claims these areas. So that’s why we’re seeing a lot of tension right now. 
HARI SREENIVASAN: And just to give people a little bit of a brief timeline – Iraqi forces control this area for a while and then in June ISIS took over the area and now it’s kind of back in Kurdish hands?
LOVEDAY MORRIS: Right. So in June 2014 Iraq lost control of a lot of the areas and we have this huge collapse in the face of an ISIS offensive. Over 100,000 soldiers fled and Kurdish forces moved in some of these areas – some of them maybe took from ISIS and others just moved into into the vacuum. And so Iraqi forces have been in these areas since June 2014. And that’s their main demand that they return to the areas. 
HARI SREENIVASAN: What’s the likelihood that this standoff right now turns violent? Into some sort of a civil war?
LOVEDAY MORRIS:: I think at this point both sides don’t want violence. Al-Abadi, the prime minister, is really trying to defuse the situation by saying there’s going to be no  military attack. But at the same time there is this buildup of forces so that I think they are trying to, in a way, intimidate the Kurds to withdraw from some areas but they don’t want to see a fight per say. But in this really tense situation there can be a small spark and things can turn violent quite easily.
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you.

"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=bb&p=230720","South Sudan civil war causes Africa’s worst refugee crisis","The United Nations says South Sudan’s four-year-old civil war has left half of the nation’s population — 6 million people — in need of humanitarian aid. The conflict began when South Sudan’s army split between factions loyal to President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar. The two men mobilized their respective tribes, the Dinka and the Nuer. The war has caused what is now one of the world’s worst refugee crises.
SIMONA FOLTYN: Civil war is emptying huge swaths of South Sudan. The violence has uprooted four million people, including two million who’ve fled to neighboring countries. In the last year, more than a million South Sudanese have poured into northern Uganda alone, crossing makeshift bridges like this one to flee fighting, hunger, and brutal attacks on civilians.
SEME LUPAI, REFUGEE: They started fighting very, very severely. So that made us to escape with our properties to this side.
SIMONA FOLTYN: When Seme Lupai’s family went to one of the refugee camps, initially, he stayed behind to look after the family’s most precious commodity — their cattle. He hid for a year to escape the violence. The refugees carry whatever they can salvage — mattresses, pots, clothes, notebooks — remnants of once peaceful lives turned upside down. At checkpoints, Ugandan soldiers search their belongings for weapons, before the refugees proceed to reception centers. After entering Uganda, the refugees sign in at small waystations. For many, it’s the first night spent in safety after walking for days to escape fighting. Levi Arike fled with his wife and four children.
LEVI ARIKE, REFUGEE: When the gunshots started, we laid under a tree with the whole family, because there was nowhere else to hide. We waited for the fighting to stop, and then we got up and started walking to Uganda.
SIMONA FOLTYN: Uganda now shoulders most of the burden of Africa’s biggest refugee crisis, managing a constellation of camps which require food, water, healthcare, and policing. At Imvepi Camp, now home to more than 120,000 South Sudanese, new arrivals receive vaccinations, hot meals, and basic items such as soap and plastic tarps to build a house. The government also gives each refugee family a small plot of land, about a twentieth of an acre, where they can build a tent shelter and grow crops to eat or sell. But the land often proves too rocky for farming.
SIMONA FOLTYN, IMVEPI REFUGEE CAMP, NORTHERN UGANDA: After completing the registration process, the new arrivals will receive their plot, to start a new life as refugees in Uganda. While they are safe here, there are many challenges ahead, not least processing the trauma of what they experienced back home.
This woman, who we’ll call “Agnes,” agreed to tell us about her harrowing experience. She says four government soldiers from President Salva Kiir’s Dinka tribe stopped her as she was fleeing South Sudan and raped her right in front of her family.
AGNES (translated to English): When they started raping me, they told me not to raise alarm, otherwise they would shoot me. Still when I’m sleeping, I’m dreaming of the Dinka, that they are coming to rape me again.
SIMONA FOLTYN: How often do you have those dreams?
AGNES: Daily, every time I lie down, those dreams come.
SIMONA FOLTYN: A recent Human Rights Watch report on South Sudan found “…a clear pattern of government forces unlawfully targeting civilians for killings, rapes, torture…and destruction of property..” The victims are from ethnic groups suspected to support the rebels.
AGNES: They are doing it, because they know very well that those soldiers are our brothers. So they do it to punish them..
SIMONA FOLTYN: Although the rebels, known as the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, purport to protect local communities, there are also reports of their fighters assaulting civilians near the Ugandan border. Josephine Yanya told us she didn’t feel safe in the presence of either side’s soldiers. Her family and neighbors fled their village after government soldiers killed her uncle.
They hid in the mountains only to find themselves under attack again, this time by opposition fighters from the Nuer tribe loyal to former vice president Riek Machar. Yanya says ethnic Nuer soldiers from the SPLA-IO rebel group raped a member of her group and stole her father’s’ cattle.
JOSEPHINE YANYA (translated to English): Before we were thinking that the rebels would protect us, but if they are lacking food, they just come and take things by force.
SIMONA FOLTYN: With nowhere left to hide, Yanya fled to Uganda with her son.
But instead of finding a place to rebuild their lives, they are in limbo. And aid groups don’t have enough food to distribute.
JOSEPHINE YANYA (translated to English):We are getting small food rations. I know it won’t be enough even for one month.
SIMONA FOLTYN: According to the United Nations, the international community has given less than a-third of the $1.4 billion dollars needed for the refugee response in South Sudan’s neighboring countries. These refugees foresee more hardship and have no idea when they might return home.
JOSEPHINE YANYA (translated to English): I’m always praying for peace in South Sudan, and until then, I’ll just stay here.

Nearly 400 more were wounded. The government blamed the al-Qaida-linked Al-Shabaab group. Rescue crews today searched for survivors at the scene of the bombing, a crowded street in the capital, Mogadishu. With dozens still missing, officials say they expect the death toll to rise.
OSMAN LIBAH IBRAHIM, Deputy Minister for Natural Resources, Somalia (through interpreter): More bodies are gradually being found and removed from the rubble. There are other people who are under the rubble. We have heard them as they scream for help. My biggest worry is that even the wounded are succumbing to their injuries.
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attack happened two days after Somalia’s defense minister and army chief resigned for undisclosed reasons.
There’s been yet another shift to the right in European politics; 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s foreign minister, is set to become that country’s next leader. But he’s short of a majority in Parliament and will likely form a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party. It was founded by ex-Nazis in the 1950s.
Kurz has called for the European Union to focus more on internal trade and securing borders. He celebrated in Vienna.
SEBASTIAN KURZ, Austrian People’s Party (through interpreter): I have a big request for you. Use today to celebrate. You all have earned it through hard work and dedication. At the same time, I need to tell you that tomorrow the work starts. We didn’t just run to win the elections. We did so to bring Austria back to the top. We ran in this election to achieve real change.
JUDY WOODRUFF: A final result in the election is likely to be decided on Thursday.
Wildfires that broke out over the weekend in Portugal have killed at least 35 people, including a one-month-old infant. Today, more than 5,300 firefighters with some 1,600 vehicles were battling the fires, some of which officials say were started by arsonists. Wildfires have also left at least four people dead in neighboring Spain.
Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl pleaded guilty today to desertion and misbehavior before the enemy. He was captured by the Taliban in 2009, after leaving his post in Afghanistan. It prompted an intense search and a prisoner swap. Bergdahl appeared before a military judge in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, today. The 31-year-old could be sentenced to life in prison. He said his actions were very inexcusable, adding he didn’t — quote — “think there’d be any reason to pull off a crucial mission to look for one guy.”
The truck driver in deadly immigrant smuggling run has pleaded guilty in court. San Antonio police found at least 39 immigrants, 10 of whom died, packed into a sweltering semi-trailer last year and died. The driver, James Matthew Bradley Jr., pleaded to conspiracy and transporting immigrants, resulting in death. He faces now up to life in prison.
A New Jersey man has been convicted of planting two pressure-cooker bombs on New York City streets last year. Ahmed Khan Rahimi faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for charges including using a weapon of mass destruction. One of the bombs exploded in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood, wounding 30. The second didn’t detonate. Officials said Rahimi was inspired by ISIS and al-Qaida.
JOHN MILLER, Deputy Commissioner, NYPD Intelligence & Counterterrorism: Ahmed Khan Rahimi learned a lesson which we keep reminding people of. This is the wrong place to try and carry out an act of terrorism. Witnesses will come forward, evidence will be developed, arrests will be made, prosecutions will be brought forth, and they will be successful.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prosecutors said Rahimi also planted a pipe bomb in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, but no one was injured.
Colin Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the national football league. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback says that he remains unsigned due to collusion by team owners over his national anthem protests. Kaepernick sparked a debate when he kneeled during the anthem last year, protesting police mistreatment of African-Americans.
On Wall Street today, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 85 points to close at 22957. The Nasdaq rose 18. And the S&P 500 added four.
It was a milestone day in the world of astronomy. For the first time, researchers say they have detected gravitational waves with a flash of light from the same cosmic event.

"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=bb&p=230850","Why a power struggle has broken out over Kirkuk","JUDY WOODRUFF: Longstanding rivalries were re-ignited in Iraq today between vital American allies.
Iraqi military forces and militia moved to push Kurdish forces out of the disputed city of Kirkuk in the country’s north.
Lisa Desjardins begins our coverage.
MAN (through interpreter): The commander in chief of the armed forces, Dr. Haider al-Abadi, gave orders to protect the people of Kirkuk and to impose security in the city.
LISA DESJARDINS: After months of simmering tensions, Iraqi federal troops moved to retake the disputed city of Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.
The effort launched before dawn. By midday, Iraqi soldiers, along with state-backed militias, quickly took control of several massive oil fields north of the city. Iraqis also captured Kirkuk’s military airport and various government buildings. They lowered what had been a symbolic Kurdish flag at the governor’s compound.
Journalist Rebecca Collard in Irbil was in Kirkuk this morning.
REBECCA COLLARD, Journalist: You could hear some clashes, some gunfire in the distance, but for the most part, the city seemed more or less abandoned. Now, the Iraqi army, by the end of today, was essentially in control of the whole city and many of the outskirts of Kirkuk.
LISA DESJARDINS: The spokesman for an Iraqi Shiite militia said they achieved all their goals with little resistance.
AHMED AL-ASSADI,  Spokesman for al-Hashed al-Shaabi (through translator): As the troops approached the area, they were confronted by some rebels, who tried to hinder the progress of the advancing units. Our troops returned fire and silenced its source.
LISA DESJARDINS: This comes three weeks after the Kurds held a nonbinding independence referendum that included the disputed province of Kirkuk.
More than 90 percent of the Kurdish region’s residents voted to split from Iraq. The Iraqi federal government, Turkey, Iran and the U.S. all rejected the independence drive.
The multiethnic region of Kirkuk lies just outside of the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq’s north. Called the country’s oil capital, Kirkuk produces around 500,000 barrels a day.
In 2014, amid the ISIS onslaught across Northern Iraq, the Kurds took control of Kirkuk, as the Iraqi military fled the city. In the three years since, the Kurds, led by their president, Massoud Barzani, sought to cement their hold, despite tensions with the central government.
Today, Kurdish officials accused Iraq of carrying out a major multipronged attack.
MAJ. GEN. AYOUB YUSUF SAID, Peshmerga Commander (through interpreter): I don’t know what is happening exactly, because we have been in this fight since 4:00 in the morning. We have suffered casualties, including martyrs, and now we have withdrawn to this position. Some of the other Kurdish forces have pulled out. They didn’t fire a single shot.
LISA DESJARDINS: While Kurdish forces withdrew from posts south of the city, some residents vowed to die fighting. Thousands of others fled north.
REBECCA COLLARD: For the last few years, the Iraqi forces, these primarily Shia militia, the Hashed Shaabi, and the Kurdish forces have been focused on fighting ISIS. Now that fight is coming to an end, and what the fear is that now these internal division in Iraq are going to become more apparent and possibly more violent.
LISA DESJARDINS: These clashes pit one substantially American-armed military force against another. Both the Kurdish forces and Iraqi government troops are part of the coalition fighting ISIS. The U.S. sought to downplay the fighting, labeling the exchange of gunfire a misunderstanding.
And, in the Rose Garden, President Trump tried to stay neutral.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We don’t like the fact that they’re clashing. We’re not taking sides. But we don’t like the fact that they’re clashing.
LISA DESJARDINS: For the PBS NewsHour, I’m Lisa Desjardins.
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more, I’m joined now by Emma Sky. She served as an adviser to General David Petraeus while he was commander of U.S. forces in Iraq from 2007 to 2010, and by Feisal Istrabadi. He’s a former Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations and he helped write Iraq’s interim constitution.
Welcome to both of you.
Let me start with you, Emma Sky.
This has happened so quickly. What exactly has the Iraqi government done?
EMMA SKY, Yale University: The Iraqi government has deployed its forces back up north into Kirkuk.
And since 2003, the Kurds have made it clear that they want to include Kirkuk within their territory in order to proceed with gaining independence, which has always been their goal. But Kirkuk is important to Iraq itself, and no Iraqi prime minister can afford to lose Kirkuk.
So you can see this reaction that has taken place following the referendum on independence, which happened September the 25th, and also included the disputed territories and the city of Kirkuk.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Feisal Istrabadi, what can you add to why the Iraqi government is so set on taking over the city?
FEISAL ISTRABADI, Former Deputy UN Ambassador, Iraq: Well, a couple of reasons.
First, as Emma just said, it is a part of the disputed territories, which are legally and constitutionally under the jurisdiction of the federal government in Baghdad. The KRG expanded into these disputed territories at the time when ISIL was expanding its territory, and then began to take steps to unilaterally declare that these areas were now incorporated into the Kurdistan region, including when it held the referendum that Emma talked about.
It included holding the referendum in these disputed territories. Now, so long as Iraq — so long as we’re talking about a single country, it matters a little less who controls Kirkuk, but once the referendum was held, this gave rise then to the second reason for Baghdad choosing to act now.
As Emma said, Kirkuk is an important oil-producing zone in Iraq. And it is vital for the economic viability of an independent Kurdish state and an important part of the economic viability of the Iraqi state. So there was never going to be a scenario, I think, in which Baghdad would allow a unilateral exercise of control by Kurds to occur over Kirkuk, so long as independence is on the table.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Emma Sky, we heard President Trump say today the U.S. is not taking sides in this.
Is that accurate, that the U.S. isn’t taking sides? What is the U.S. role here?
EMMA SKY: Well, the U.S. has stipulated over and over again that its policy is to support a united Iraq.
So you can see the U.S. has given support to Iraqi security forces, but also to the Kurdish Peshmerga, to fight against ISIS. The U.S. policy for the last few years has really been focused on ISIS and not on the day after ISIS.
But what we’re witnessing at the moment is that different groups are already moving to the day after, which is the power struggle for control of different territories in Iraq.
And Barzani believed that during the fight against ISIS, he became stronger because he got weapons directly from the international community. And, as Feisal said, he was able to extend his control over the disputed territories.
He’s also facing domestic problems within Kurdistan. There are tensions between the different Kurdish groups, and some believe that Barzani has overstayed his term as president.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which reminds us just how complicated this is, Feisal Istrabadi.
What does the Iraqi central government want here? They’re not going to get rid of the Kurds. What is it that they want?
FEISAL ISTRABADI: Oh, well, I mean, the Kurds of course are a vital part of Iraq. They’re a vital part of the political process, and they have been represented in Baghdad. The president of Iraq is a Kurd and has been since 2005.
I think what needs to occur and I hope what the government of Iraq wants is a negotiated settlement, in which no party dictates terms to the other, but a negotiated settlement.
Look, Irbil has some legitimate agreements with respect to Baghdad. Baghdad has some legitimate agreements with respect to Irbil. I think we need a mediator perhaps or somebody to convene a roundtable — the United States is who I’m thinking of, of course — to address some of those issues.
Most of the issues are, from the Irbil side, economic issues of payments, and from Baghdad’s side, transparency of how much oil Irbil is producing and exporting, which Irbil has never accounted for to Baghdad.
I think if those issues are resolved, perhaps hopefully some of these other issues can at least be delayed for another day. But at the end of the day, neither government — neither the regional government nor the federal government in Baghdad can really tolerate dictation of terms to it by the other side. My hope is that a negotiated settlement obtains.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Emma Sky, where do you see this going from here? Do you see the peace that different sides have worked to hard to create in Iraq unraveling as a result of this?
EMMA SKY: I think there is an opportunity for a deal, and I think the sort of deal that could be negotiated is one that looks at a special status for the city of Kirkuk and negotiated terms for Kurdistan’s separate, whether that be towards confederation or towards independence.
But there needs to be negotiation. There needs to be a look at where should the border between Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest of Iraq actually be, and that requires mediation district by district through those territories.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know there are other players who are playing an important role here in Iran and Turkey, and this is all very much playing out as we watch, watch it happen in Iraq.
Emma Sky, Feisal Istrabadi, thank you very much.
FEISAL ISTRABADI: Thank you.
EMMA SKY: Thank you.

He may now form a government with a far-right party founded in the 1950s by former Nazis.
That follows recent elections in Germany, where a far-right party roiled the race and dealt a blow to returning leader Angela Merkel.
In Sweden, too, there is a strong challenge from the right and a neo-Nazi group that looks stand in elections next year.
Special correspondent Malcolm Brabant ha been surveying the political landscape in Germany and Sweden, and he begins his report in Scandinavia.
MALCOLM BRABANT, Special Correspondent: In a Gothenburg parking lot, supporters of the Nordic Resistance Movement form up for what they hope will be their biggest-ever march, to propagate an ideology espoused by mother of eight Paulina Forslund.
PAULINA FORSLUND, Nordic Resistance Movement: When white becomes the minority, they will be destroyed. I want my children to have a secure future. I want them not only for them to have a secure Sweden. I want them to have a secure world. And I want other people to fight for the same thing.
MALCOLM BRABANT: When addressing her fellow neo-Nazis, Forslund’s rhetoric sharpens.
PAULINA FORSLUND (through interpreter): I’m the welder’s daughter, the forester’s grandchild. My line consists of hardworking men and women. It’s people like them we can thank for the welfare system that our lying politicians are now giving away to imported scum.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Clearly expecting trouble, the movement’s leaders have a muscular protection detail, marching past a silent protest. The sign reads “No Nazis on our streets.”
This protester would only give her name as Johanna.
JOHANNA, Anti-Nazi Protester: They are racist people. They are people who think that certain people are better than others, and I will not stand for that. It’s not something I think has a place in a modern society.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Experts say the resistance movement is recruiting aggressively, and believe this demonstration is emblematic of the rise of the far right.
It took place on Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement.
Allan Stutzinky is leader of Gothenburg’s Jewish community.
ALLAN STUTZINKY, Jewish Community Leader (through interpreter): Nazism has returned. The descendants of the murderers are organizing the same marches today, waving the same flags, shouting the same slogans, and have the same racist agenda.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Anna Johansson is a member of the governing Social Democrat Party. It’s considering outlawing the Nordic Resistance Movement.
ANNA JOHANSSON, Swedish Social Democratic Party: In Sweden and in Denmark, and in other countries, extreme parties are growing, and the hatred is spreading around.
MALCOLM BRABANT: “Go home to mama,” he shouts. “Nazi pigs,” chant the anti- fascist protesters, as a bottle flies through the air.
DAMON, Nordic Resistance Movement: If someone calls themselves a Nazi, most of us would dissociate with that person. That’s nothing we stand for ourselves. I never call myself a Nazi. I’m a national socialist.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hitler’s party was also called National Socialist, but Damon, a 40-year-old welder, insists he’s a nonviolent family man.
DAMON: The demographic landscape of our — of the whole of Europe is changing, so, basically, it’s a concern on preserving my heritage for my family and our kin.
MALCOLM BRABANT: This demonstration has been stopped short of its destination. The Nordic Resistance Movement is currently trapped between a line of police and anti-fascist protesters. And it looks as though this demonstration isn’t going any further.
Violence briefly erupts as the resistance movement tries to break through police lines, and several marchers are arrested.
PAULINA FORSLUND: We are not your enemy. We are the government’s enemy.
They say we live in a democracy, but we have never had an election about if we want to take all these people in.
MALCOLM BRABANT: When Europe’s refugee crisis began in 2015, Sweden copied Germany’s open-door policy, and 160,000 migrants entered the country. Two years on, Sweden has tighter borders and has begun deporting some of the newcomers.
The new atmosphere alarms Floid Gumbo, entertaining an anti-Nazi rally.
FLOID GUMBO, Singer Originally from Zimbabwe: I came to Sweden over 20 years ago. The climate in Sweden, the people were so friendly, and things were completely different, more welcoming. And I feel like things have sort of gradually changed.
I’m very concerned, because I have children, because I’m thinking what I experienced here is not the same kind of climate, atmosphere that they are going to experience here.
ANNA JOHANSSON: It’s not so long ago that the Nazis ruined Europe. And that makes me very worried. The German elections were terrifying, I think.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Johansson is referring to last month’s success of the right-wing Alternative For Germany Party, or AFD, when it entered Parliament for the first time with 13 percent of the vote.
HUGH BRONSON, Alternative For Germany Party: The AFD only came into existence because Merkel deserted the traditional conservative Christian voters. They were looking for a home, and the AFD has offered them a safe place.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Hugh Bronson is deputy leader of the AFD in Berlin.
Now his party, the third largest in Parliament, is demanding that Angela Merkel imposes tougher immigration rules.
Your opponents claim that you are a party of hate. What’s your response to that?
HUGH BRONSON: We embrace foreigners who respect our laws, pay their taxes, send their children to school, and go about their normal life. The problem is with people who abuse the system to have a better life, or let others pay for their better lives, or who are criminals.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Outside the opera house in Dresden, former East Germany, singer Luca Bergelt is dismayed by the political landscape shifting to the right.
LUCA BERGELT, Singer: My fear is that they will tear Europe apart. They are going to raise up the walls again. They’re going to build new walls between the countries, and that Europe will get more close into itself.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Anti-immigrant sentiment is strong in Dresden. The city was the birthplace of a pan-European anti-Islamic movement, and it delivered the largest number of votes for the right-wing party.
On a holiday to celebrate German unification after the fall of communism, retired engineer Wilfried Schmidt explained why he sent a message to Angela Merkel.
WILFRIED SCHMIDT, Retired Engineer (through interpretor): Let’s put it this way. We all need to recognize that Germany is undergoing social changes that are becoming harder to control. For one, there is mass immigration from difficult regions that is increasingly uncontrollable, of people with entirely different concepts of life, from fundamental differently structured societies that are problematic.
MALCOLM BRABANT: About one million migrants poured into Germany in 2015. Chancellor Merkel consistently defended her pro-refugee policies, but now she has been punished by voters who believe she ignored their concerns.
Chancellor Merkel has promised to listen to the people who voted for the AFD, and she says she’s going to try to win them over with what she calls good politics. But she will not countenance having the party in her coalition.
But the chancellor needs to find new partners who are prepared to be tough on immigration.
As she tries to forge a coalition, the chancellor has agreed to put an annual cap of 200,000 on the number of immigrants, something she previously refused to do. But will it be enough to woo back people who deserted her at the election?
A question for Werner Patzelt, a political scientist at Dresden University.
WERNER PATZELT, Dresden University: Since Chancellor Merkel has made so many U-turns in German domestic politics, it wouldn’t be a surprise if she would try to do a U-turn, also winning back AFD voters.
But this is a really hard political task, because so many of them are so much disappointed by the Christian Democratic Union in general, and by Chancellor Merkel in particular, that they will do anything to avoid going back.
MALCOLM BRABANT: Back in Sweden, the governing party is horrified at the concept of conceding ground to right-wingers, and is trying to isolate them.
ANNA JOHANSSON: Experience shows that, when you adopt the ideas from these right-wing parties, they spread. These parties have their agenda implemented by other parties. And I wouldn’t want to see that happen in Sweden.
FLOID GUMBO: We’re all human beings. We share this world. We’re all here. There’s enough space for us all.
MALCOLM BRABANT: But that’s an appeal that an increasing number of Swedes are rejecting, as the country and much of Europe go through a crisis of identity.

But beyond the words, Xi is asserting power like no Chinese leader in decades.
William Brangham reports.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The applause, the music, it was a reception befitting the commanding role that Xi Jinping has taken since being named party leader five years ago.
He opened today’s proceedings by hailing reforms he’s put in place, and proclaiming a — quote — “new era for China.”
PRESIDENT XI JINPING, China (through interpreter): The Chinese nation has realized a great leap, from declining in modern history to twisting its fate fundamentally and continuously moving to prosperity.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over 3.5 hours, Xi laid out his vision to shape the nation of 1.4 billion people into what he called a — quote — “great modern socialist country” over the next three decades.
PRESIDENT XI JINPING (through interpreter): Achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation will be no walk in the park, and it will take more than drumbeating and gong-clanging to get there. The whole party must be prepared to make more arduous, strenuous efforts.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Susan Shirk is chair of the 21st Century China Center at the University of California, San Diego.
SUSAN SHIRK, University of California, San Diego: Xi Jinping has a vision of China’s role in the world that is much more ambitious than anything we have seen before, talking about China kind of moving toward the center of the world and having a lot more influence than it did before.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In his address, Xi largely ignored the question of political reforms in China, and he didn’t mention President Trump or North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.
But in a rare move, he did acknowledge that with global demand weakening, there were challenges facing China’s export-driven economy.
PRESIDENT XI JINPING (through interpreter):  While China’s overall productive forces have significantly improved and in many areas our production capacity leads the world, the more prominent problem is that our development is unbalanced and inadequate.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Xi was one of the first foreign leaders to meet with President Trump.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The relationship developed by President Xi and myself, I think, is outstanding.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That was decidedly warmer than Mr. Trump’s past criticism of China and its economic and trade policies.
But other U.S. officials are more critical of Beijing’s actions.
REX TILLERSON, Secretary of State: China, while rising alongside India, has done so less responsibly.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson today criticized China’s aggressive displays of economic and military power, particularly its expansion on man-made islands in the South China Sea.
REX TILLERSON: We will not shrink from China’s challenges to the rules-based order, and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.
SUSAN SHIRK: I think there are things to worry about in Chinese foreign policy that are mostly related to these maritime sovereignty issues and to a kind of bullying in Asia, but the global ambition could turn out to be positive.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Susan Shirk says China has filled a vacuum left by the United States’ withdrawal from global agreements like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris climate accords.
Perhaps the most important thing to watch for in the next few days is who Xi establishes as his likely successor.
SUSAN SHIRK: That is why there is a lot of speculation now that he may be trying, much like Putin, to stay on beyond his normal term or to rule behind the scenes even after he retires.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President Trump will be traveling to Beijing to meet Xi next month.

However, the largest city the militants once held was Mosul in Iraq. They were ousted from it in July after a brutal 10-month-long fight that killed thousands.
Now a new major task: finding and destroying the ISIS mines, booby-traps and bombs that litter the city.
Special correspondent Marcia Biggs reports from Iraq.
MARCIA BIGGS, Special Correspondent: It was once a center of learning for over 6,000 students of technology, agriculture, and medicine.
Today, Mosul Technical Institute’s classrooms are burnt to the ground, laboratories reduced to rubble, and books charred and shredded. It’s one of the city’s five universities ravaged by the Islamic State and the battle to oust it.
Now that the battle is over, a new danger looms, the trail of land mines and booby-traps left by ISIS.
So this is the wire, and this is where it was buried.
CHRISTIAN, Team Leader, Janus Global Operations: Yes, they would cut the asphalt, and then they lay the wire in and put the main charge here.
MARCIA BIGGS: We spent the day with Christian, a team leader from Janus Global, a security and risk management firm hired by the U.S. government to sweep and clear major areas of unexploded ordnance and mines.
He’s not allowed to show his face or use his last name, for security reasons.
CHRISTIAN: There’s actually two more on that road before we get to the target building that have to be excavated and/or rendered safe.
MARCIA BIGGS: So, the first building you have to clear, you have got to get rid of the IEDs on the road to that building?
CHRISTIAN: Yes.
MARCIA BIGGS: It’s a long process.
CHRISTIAN: It is, but that’s what makes it interesting.
MARCIA BIGGS: The United States has sunk $30 million this year into clearing former ISIS territories all over Northern Iraq. Under this program, Janus has already cleared 727 buildings, removing 3,000 IEDs, which they say ISIS was producing on assembly lines at an industrial scale.
But State Department officials and experts say the number of unexploded ordnance in Mosul itself is unprecedented.
What’s your first line of attack, in terms of trying to clear Mosul?
CHRISTIAN: Our priority is more the community, rather than the individual, you know, infrastructure. You have got schools, power, sewer, water, so that the area can accept people back into it. And then, once this stabilization phase is over, we can move into the individual homes, so that they can be safer.
MARCIA BIGGS: Clearing Mosul is a process that they say could take years, even decades. So Janus is training local Iraqis to do the job, sending them out as a front-line search team, then investigating and removing any suspicious items themselves.
CHRISTIAN: We’re not going to be here the whole time, so when we — it’s our time to leave, they will have the capacity built from us, and the mentoring we have done, so that they can do it on their own.
MARCIA BIGGS: How are they doing?
CHRISTIAN: They’re — a lot of them are very apt to learn. They’re quick. They’re smart.
MARCIA BIGGS: Fawzi al Nabdi is the team leader for the Iraqi local partner. He’s cleared mines all over Iraq for the last six years.
CHRISTIAN: What you got?
FAWZI AL NABDI, Team Leader, Al Fahad Company (through interpreter): We are ready for this, because it’s my job and I love it. The Americans are here to complete our work and to help us. They have greater experience than we do. If we find any mines, we have to stop and they will investigate it and make a plan to remove it.
MARCIA BIGGS: But he says Mosul is the biggest project he has ever seen, and we’re told it could take at least a month to just get the campus cleared of mines. Only then can they start cleaning it up, so that students can resume classes, this itself a huge task.
ISIS fighters closed the university back in 2014, and used it as a military base. As coalition forces pounded ISIS targets, this seat of higher learning became a battleground.
Ghassan Alubaidy is the institute’s dean.
GHASSAN ALUBAIDY, Dean, Mosul Technical Institute (through interpreter): ISIS used our university to manufacture mines and bombs. For this reason, it was the target of airstrikes in the beginning. They struck the institute nine times, and they struck our workshops, too. Now we can’t use them.
MARCIA BIGGS: The former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, recently listed 81 locations where bombs were dropped, but had not yet exploded.
Facilities used to make weapons were often on the list of high-value targets for the coalition. So now those places are twice as likely to contain dangerous items.
So, this was once a workshop for electrical engineering students. You can still see the lab tables here. It was hit by an airstrike in 2015. Afterwards, members of the university staff found bomb-making instructions among the rubble. This was likely an ISIS bomb-making factory, and judging by the crater, a high-value target.
Despite the damage, Dean Alubaidy says he will hold classes this fall in alternate buildings, until the campus is ready. He’s expecting registration to be in the thousands, students who lost three years of education during the fighting and don’t want to lose another one.
GHASSAN ALUBAIDY (through interpreter): On our Facebook pages, we found a great number of students posting that they were full of encouragement to come back. For us, it was unbelievable. We couldn’t imagine it, to see how many students wanted to start again, how they were dreaming of the first day of classes, when they could sit in front of teachers again and start to live their lives again.
MARCIA BIGGS: Next door, Mosul University has already started classes. Students even volunteered to help in the cleanup.
But across the river, West Mosul was the site of ISIS’ last stand and bore the brunt of the battle. It’s densely packed Old City, with its flattened buildings, is a challenge for mine-sweeping.
FAWZI AL-NABDI (through interpreter): Most of the homes here were full of mines. And just here in front of us, a man with two kids came back to his home, and when he opened the door, the bomb killed him and his kids.
MARCIA BIGGS: Ahmed Younes fled back in early July with only the clothes on his back. Residents have been virtually banned from returning to his neighborhood on the outskirts of the Old City, but Ahmed said he got special permission, in order to retrieve some personal items.
AHMED YOUNES, Local Resident (through interpreter): We came on our own. We got permission to come, but they are not responsible if anything happens to us.
MARCIA BIGGS: Right now, there is no plan to begin clearing the Old City or even to determine how many mines there are. It is still out of bounds to anyone but the Iraqi security forces.
So the Janus team is focusing on progress in the rest of the city, building by building, bomb by bomb.
CHRISTIAN: Whoever made this device had a set goal. And to allow him to win, people get hurt. So you kind of compete against him to be better than him to take it out before it can do any harm.
MARCIA BIGGS: So, you feel like you’re winning the battle against ISIS?
CHRISTIAN: Yes, one IED at a time.
MARCIA BIGGS: For the PBS NewsHour, I’m Marcia Biggs in Mosul, Iraq.
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tune in later.

At least 231 people were killed and hundreds more wounded after a massive truck bomb on Saturday struck Somalia’s capital city of Mogadishu. 
The Somali government has blamed the al-Qaida-linked militant group al-Shabab for the attack, and called it the deadliest ever to hit the nation.
The blast took place outside the Safari Hotel, where rescue workers dug through the rubble of collapsed buildings overnight in search of survivors. Witnesses described a devastating scene with large-scale carnage, as doctors worked feverishly to attend to the dead and injured, many badly burned. 
“The hospital is overwhelmed by both dead and wounded,” Dr. Mohamed Yusuf, the director of Medina hospital located near the blast, told the Associated Press. “We also received people whose limbs were cut away by the bomb. This is really horrendous, unlike any other time in the past.”
Photos and videos of the bombing, which took place on a busy street near a section of the city housing foreign embassies, showed collapsed walls, twisted metal, and sporadic fires spewing smoke. The Qatari government said its embassy was “severely damaged” in the strike.

Family members searched through the wreckage and waited at local hospitals with the hopes of finding relatives who survived the bombing. 
Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed announced three days of mourning. The attacks received international condemnation, including from the United States.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the North Korean crisis “will continue until the first bomb drops.”
That statement comes despite President Donald Trump’s tweets a couple of weeks ago that his chief envoy was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with “Little Rocket Man,” a mocking nickname Trump has given the nuclear-armed nation’s leader, Kim Jong Un.
“I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table. And we have spent substantial time actually perfecting those,” Tillerson told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “But be clear: The president has also made clear to me that he wants this solved diplomatically. He’s not seeking to go to war.”
Recent mixed messaging from the top of the U.S. government has raised concerns about the potential for miscalculation amid the increasingly bellicose exchange of words by Trump and the North Korean leader.
Trump told the U.N. General Assembly last month that if the U.S. is “forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” Trump also tweeted that Korea’s leadership “won’t be around much longer” if it continued its provocations, a declaration that led the North’s foreign minister to assert that Trump had “declared war on our country.”
Tillerson acknowledged during a recent trip to Beijing that the Trump administration was keeping open direct channels of communications with North Korea and probing the North’s willingness to talk. He provided no elaboration about those channels or the substance of any discussions.
Soon after, Trump took to Twitter, saying he had told “our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man … Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!” Trump offered no further explanation, but he said all military options are on the table for dealing with North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.
Analysts have speculated about whether the president and his top diplomat were playing “good cop, bad cop” with North Korea, and how China might interpret the confusing signals from Washington. Beijing is the North’s main trading partner, and the U.S. is counting on China to enforce U.N. sanctions.
“Rest assured that the Chinese are not confused in any way what the American policy towards North Korea (is) or what our actions and efforts are directed at,” Tillerson said.
Asked if Trump’s tweets undermined Tillerson, the secretary said: “I think what the president is doing is he’s trying to motivate action on a number of people’s part, in particular the regime in North Korea. I think he does want to be clear with Kim Jong Un and that regime in North Korea that he has military preparations ready to go and he has those military options on the table and we have spent substantial time perfecting those.”
He added that Trump “has made it clear to me to continue my diplomatic efforts, which we are, and I’ve told others those diplomatic efforts will continue until the first bomb drops.”
North Korea has launched missiles that potentially can strike the U.S. mainland and recently conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion. It has threatened to explode another nuclear bomb above the Pacific.

TOKYO — U.S. and Japanese diplomats agreed Tuesday to maximize pressure on North Korea to resolve tensions over its nuclear program, while citing the need to be prepared for the worst if diplomacy fails.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, after meeting his Japanese counterpart, Shinsuke Sugiyama, told reporters that the focus at the State Department is still on diplomacy to solve the problem and eventually denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
“We must, however, with our allies in Japan and South Korea and elsewhere, be prepared for the worst should diplomacy fail,” he said. The U.S. must be prepared to defend itself and its allies, he said.
Sugiyama, briefing reporters separately, reiterated Japan’s support for President Donald Trump’s policy of keeping all options open, but stressed the need for a diplomatic solution by bolstering cooperation among Japan, U.S. and South Korea, as well as via cooperation with China and Russia.
The two diplomats will join their South Korean counterpart in Seoul for further talks Wednesday on North Korea.
READ MORE: Rex Tillerson says continue diplomacy with North Korea ‘until first bomb drops’
The talks come as the U.S. and South Korea hold joint naval drills this week. They regularly conduct joint exercises, though North Korea condemns them as an invasion rehearsal.
North Korea’s deputy U.N. ambassador warned on Monday that the situation on the peninsula “has reached the touch-and-go point and a nuclear war may break out any moment.”
Kim In Ryong told the U.N. General Assembly’s disarmament committee that North Korea has been subjected to a direct nuclear threat from the United States and has the right to possess nuclear weapons in self-defense.
He pointed to military exercises and what he called a U.S. plan to stage a “secret operation aimed at the removal of our supreme leadership.”
Kim’s speech follows increasingly tough U.N. sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is curtailing economic, scientific and other ties with North Korea in line with U.N. sanctions, and the European Union announced new sanctions as well.

U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces announced Tuesday that they had captured the city of Raqqa from Islamic State militants.
“Everything is finished in Raqqa, our forces have taken full control of Raqqa,” SDF spokesman Talal Sello told AFP. A formal declaration would be announced after operations to clear any remaining sleeper cells and to remove landmines in the city were completed, Sello added.
The move is a major setback for the Islamic State which considered Raqqa the de-facto capital of its self-declared caliphate. It comes on the third anniversary of the global effort to defeat ISIS.
Raqqa was the first provincial capital to fall from government control in March 2013 after it was captured by a rebel army. The army included both Syrian opposition groups and more hard line  parties including al-Nusra and the Islamic State.
A civilian government  that was established in the city divided two months later, and less than a year later ISIS recaptured Raqqa and named the the capital of their caliphate.
About 900 civilians have been killed since the the start of the five-month operation, including 570 people in coalition air raids, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the civilian death toll at 1,130 people. American journalist James Foley was beheaded in the mountains south of the city.
SDF fighters pulled down the Islamic State’s black flag from the city’s National Hospital near the city’s stadium, according to a Reuters report.
Special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS Brett McGurk said in August that the U.S. would attempt to perform a “stabilization” in Raqqa — including demining, removing rubble from major pathways to allow trucks and equipment through, and “basic electricity, sewage, water, the basic essentials to allow populations to come back to their home.”
It is not clear when the 300,000 civilians who have fled Raqqa since April during the operation will be able to return.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson speaks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Wednesday.
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is condemning reported atrocities committed against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, and he says those responsible — perhaps the country’s military — will be held accountable.
Tillerson says accounts of the suffering of the Rohingya are “heartbreaking” — and that if those reports are true, then “someone is going to be held to account for that.”
Tillerson — who’s set to visit South Asia next week — is urging the Myanmar government to improve humanitarian access to the population in western Rakhine state.
Amnesty International has accused Myanmar’s security forces of killing hundreds of men, women and children during a systematic campaign to expel the Rohingya. More than 580,000 refugees have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August.
“We really hold the military leadership accountable for what’s happening,” Tillerson said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “What’s most important to us is that the world can’t just stand idly by and be witness to the atrocities that are being reported in that area.”
He also called Wednesday for the U.S. and India to expand strategic ties. He pointedly criticized China, which he accused of challenging international norms needed for global stability.
He said the world needed the U.S. and India to have a strong partnership. The two nations share goals of security, free navigation, free trade and fighting terrorism in the Indo-Pacific, and serve as “the eastern and western beacons” for an international rules-based order which is increasingly under strain, he said.
Both India and China had benefited from that order, but Tillerson said India had done so while respecting rules and norms, while China had “at times” undermined them. To make his point, he alluded to China’s island building and expansive territorial claims in seas where Beijing has long-running disputes with Southeast Asian neighbors.
“China’s provocative actions in the South China Sea directly challenge the international law and norms that the United States and India both stand for,” Tillerson said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
He added that the U.S. seeks constructive relations with China but “won’t shrink” from the challenges it poses when it “subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries, and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends.”
U.S.-India relations have generally prospered in the past decade, in part because of their shared concerns about the rise of China. While President Donald Trump has looked to deepen cooperation with China on addressing the nuclear threat from North Korea, he’s also sought a closer relationship with India, which shares U.S. worries on Islamic extremism.
“In this period of uncertainty and angst, India needs a reliable partner on the world stage. I want to make clear: with our shared values and vision for global stability, peace and prosperity, the United States is that partner,” Tillerson said.
Tillerson said the U.S. wants to help improve India’s military capabilities, and also improve security cooperation among the region’s major democracies, which included Japan and Australia.
Tillerson said the U.S. and India were leading regional efforts on counterterrorism. He called for India’s archrival Pakistan “to take decisive action against terrorist groups based within their own borders that threaten its own people and the broader region.”

More than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled their homes since August to escape systematic violence at the hands of government soldiers in Myanmar. The U.N. has called the actions taken by Myanmar forces against the group “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.”
A report released by Amnesty International on Wednesday documents widespread rape, killings and burnings of Rohingya across the Rakhine State in Myanmar. The report includes extensive interviews of Rohingya refugees who tell stories of live burnings, sexual violence and mass shootings at the hands of soldiers. 
To escape persecution, Rohingya refugees are fleeing in droves to neighboring Bangladesh, a country described by some as a reluctant host for the thousands of refugees behind its borders. Conditions within Bangladesh show refugee camps beyond capacity, as organizations struggle to keep up with humanitarian aid. 
Find out more: Rohingya Muslims have been denied citizenship in Myanmar since 1982, though they’ve lived in the area since the 12th century.  They are not considered one of the country’s official ethnic groups. As such, their lack of official identity bars them from government services and travel.
Officials from Myanmar, a majority Buddhist state, claim Rohingya are actually immigrants from Bangladesh to justify their exclusion of the group. This most recent burst of violence comes from Myanmar’s crackdown following clashes with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA). After the government declared ARSA a terrorist organization, the retaliation escalated into hundreds of Rohingya villages.

"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/?post_type=updates&p=230698","Column: Why reporting from South Sudan is so difficult — and critically needed","
In August, fellow reporter Jason Patinkin and I crossed on foot from northern Uganda into rebel-held South Sudan. Over the course of four days, we walked more than 40 miles through the bush, escorted by rebel soldiers, to shed light on one of the world’s most underreported conflicts.
Reporting on South Sudan’s war, which began in 2013, has always been a challenge due to the risk and logistical hurdles associated with accessing remote areas where fighting takes place. But over the past year, covering the war and its humanitarian fallout has become particularly difficult. Since the beginning of this year, South Sudan’s government has banned at least 20 foreign journalists in an apparent effort to silence reporters who had a track record of critically reporting on the government.
 The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. 
This systematic crackdown on the foreign press (South Sudanese journalists have long risked imprisonment and death for doing their work) coincided with two important developments. In November 2016, the United Nations warned that the violence being committed against civilians in the southern region of Equatoria risked spiraling into genocide. Then, in February, the UN declared a man-made famine, warning that 100,000 people were at risk of starving to death as a result of civil war.
Journalists seeking to cover these events were left with two equally unsavory options: self-censorship or a risky trip to rebel-held parts of the country. Only a handful of journalists have attempted the latter since fighting escalated in July last year. For us, this was our second embed with the rebels this year.

We set off from a town in northern Uganda at five in the morning, bouncing along a bumpy dirt track towards the South Sudan border. Crammed into our four-wheel drive were rebel commander Martin Abucha, a dual American and South Sudanese citizen who we planned to profile for our PBS NewsHour Weekend segment, a couple of guides, and several duffle bags stuffed with our tents, sleeping bags, emergency medical kits and provisions to last us four days.  
Just as the sun began to rise above a distant range of hills that we aimed to cross later that day, our car came to a halt in front of a stream. Because of the rainy reason, it carried more water than usual. It was time to disembark and start walking, or “footing,” as South Sudanese tend to call it.
We took off our shoes and waded through the stream’s chilly waters. This was the first of a many rivers we’d have to cross along the way, either on foot or in small flimsy canoes dug out from tree trunks. Each time, we dreaded the idea of falling in with our camera gear. 
The first part of our journey in northern Uganda felt very much like a hike through a national park. Passing beautiful landscapes and idyllic farming villages, one could almost forget we were headed into a war zone — but we were about to get a reality check.
We had just crossed into South Sudan when out of nowhere, two dozen armed men popped out of the tall grass and surrounded us at gunpoint.
“Stop! Who are you and where are you going?” a soldier called out in Juba Arabic from his hideout no more than 20 yards away, pointing his AK47 at us. Another one next to him had a rocket-propelled grenade propped on his shoulder, also unequivocally aiming it in our direction.  
Instinctively, we threw our hands in the air and exchanged a baffled glance. Had we accidentally bumped into government soldiers? Or perhaps we had come onto the “wrong” rebels? Abucha’s group, called the Sudan People’s Liberation Army In Opposition, is the biggest but not the only armed group in Equatoria, an area rife with rival militia and bandits who exploit the security vacuum left by war.
To our relief, and only after Abucha answered a series of questions, this routine security check quickly gave way to a warm welcome. The platoon would be our escort for the next four days as we trekked to their base and to Loa, Abucha’s hometown.
Keeping up with the rebels was no easy task. Given the country’s pervasive lack of basic infrastructure, South Sudanese grow up walking for dozens of miles just to go about their daily lives. For sedentary Westerners, keeping the target pace of “two meters per second” (around five miles an hour) proved challenging amid 90-degree temperatures, all while filming and plowing our way through dense, itchy elephant grass. 
The upside of the cumbersome terrain was that it kept us safe. During our four-day trip, we didn’t cross a single road, instead walking along a dizzying network of narrow bush paths the rebels seemed to know like the backs of their hands. An unwanted encounter with government troops, who tended to stick to roads and move around in vehicles as opposed to on foot, was highly unlikely.
The closest we got to government-controlled area was a visit to Loa, located just two kilometers away from a main road frequently patrolled by government soldiers. We couldn’t stay long, but the hour we spent on the ground offered us a glimpse into what villages must look like in many parts of Equatoria: burned mud huts, looted schools and clinics, fallow fields and – most strikingly – no civilians.  
The war has had a devastating impact on South Sudanese communities like the one in Loa, but much of it has remained out of the limelight of international media. Our four-day venture into rebel-held South Sudan offered us a rare opportunity to report ground truths, and we are thankful for that.

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/3-american-troops-killed-25-injured-attack-jordan-base-near-syria-border","3 American troops killed, 25 injured in attack on Jordan base near Syria border","Three U.S. service members were killed and at least 25 others were injured in a drone attack on an outpost in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border, U.S. Central Command confirmed on Sunday.  But a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News the injury toll could rise to higher than 25 Americans. Most, if not all, of those injured and killed were Army soldiers based in northern Jordan near the Syrian border at a base known as Tower 22, which has been in support of the counter-ISIS mission for year, the official said.  Some of the 25-plus injured have been medically evacuated from the base, likely to Landstuhl in Germany, according to the official. It is not clear if they were hit while sleeping in the residential compound at the base. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is actively engaged in discussions taking place at the White House about how to respond. ""On Jan. 28, three U.S. service members were killed and 25 injured from a one-way attack UAS that impacted at a base in northeast Jordan, near the Syria border. As a matter of respect for the families and in accordance with DoD policy, the identities of the servicemembers will be withheld until 24 hours after their next of kin have been notified,"" CENTCOM said in a statement. ""Updates will be provided as they become available,"" the statement added.  The White House said President Biden was briefed Sunday morning by Austin, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer about the attack, which marked a significant escalation as it's the first time U.S. troops have been killed by enemy fire in the Middle East since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7. US WITHDRAWAL FROM SYRIA WOULD PUT 'WHOLE REGION AT RISK,' ALLOW IRAN TO 'SOW' MORE DISCORD, EXPERT WARNS U.S. troops long have used Jordan as a basing point, and the attack took place in northeast Jordan near the Syrian border.  Biden blasted ""radical Iran-backed militant groups"" in reacting to the attack. ""Today, America’s heart is heavy. Last night, three U.S. service members were killed – and many wounded – during an unmanned aerial drone attack on our forces stationed in northeast Jordan near the Syria border,"" he said. ""While we are still gathering the facts of this attack, we know it was carried out by radical Iran-backed militant groups operating in Syria and Iraq."" YEMEN’S HOUTHIS FIRE MISSILE TOWARD USS CARNEY, CENTCOM SAYS ""Jill and I join the families and friends of our fallen – and Americans across the country – in grieving the loss of these warriors in this despicable and wholly unjust attack,"" Biden continued. ""These service members embodied the very best of our nation: Unwavering in their bravery. Unflinching in their duty. Unbending in their commitment to our country – risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism. It is a fight we will not cease."" ""The three American service members we lost were patriots in the highest sense,"" the president said. ""And their ultimate sacrifice will never be forgotten by our nation. Together, we will keep the sacred obligation we bear to their families. We will strive to be worthy of their honor and valor. We will carry on their commitment to fight terrorism. And have no doubt – we will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner our choosing.""  In the wake of the attack, Republicans condemned Biden's perceived inaction so far and some went further, accusing the president of appeasing Iran. ""Iran’s proxies have launched over 150 attacks on US troops since October, as the Iran-backed Houthis attack global shipping, and Iran-backed Hezbollah and Hamas attack our ally Israel. The Biden administration’s failed Middle East policy has destroyed our deterrence against adversaries in the Middle East. We need a major reset of our Middle East policy to protect our national security interests and restore deterrence,"" House Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said.  ""Enough is enough. The Biden administration’s appeasement of Iran must end. It’s time for clear and decisive action, and Iran must be held accountable for the malign activities of its proxies,"" Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.  ""It’s long past time for President Biden to finally hold the terrorist Iranian regime and their extremist proxies accountable for the attacks they’ve carried out against U.S. and coalition forces,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said. Some 3,000 American troops typically are stationed in Jordan, according to the Associated Press.  The unnamed U.S. officials cited in several reports say the attack happened at Tower 22, a small outpost in northeast Jordan located close to Al-Tanf garrison in southeastern Syria, where U.S. forces have collaborated with local partners combating Islamic State militants. The Jordanian government is reportedly saying otherwise. Jordanian state television quoted Muhannad al Mubaidin, a government spokesperson, who said the attack happened outside the kingdom across the border in Syria. Reuters also cited al Mubaidin as telling Jordanian public broadcaster al Mamlaka television that the attack had targeted the U.S. Al-Tanf base in Syria. The conflicting information could not be immediately reconciled. Since Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip began, U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria have faced drone and missile attacks on their bases, but Sunday's marked the first U.S. fatalities. Syria is still in the midst of a civil war and has long been a launchpad for Iranian-backed forces there, including the Lebanon-based terrorist organization Hezbollah. Iraq has multiple Iranian-backed Shiite militias operating there as well. Jordan, a staunch Western ally and a crucial power in Jerusalem for its oversight of holy sites there, is suspected of launching airstrikes in Syria to disrupt drug smugglers, including one that killed nine people this month, according to the AP.

""The drone attack on a U.S. Military Installation in Jordan, killing 3 American Servicemembers, and wounding many more, marks a horrible day for America. My most profound sympathies go to the Families of the Brave Servicemembers (sic) we have lost,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social page. He continued his first part of a three-part series by asking for all Americans to join him in praying for those who were wounded and calling out President Biden and his administration. ""This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence of Joe Biden’s weakness and surrender,"" Trump continued. ""Three years ago, Iran was weak, broke, and totally under control. Thanks to my Maximum Pressure policy, the Iranian Regime could barely scrape two dollars together to fund their terrorist proxies.

Jean Carroll's claims against Trump, lifestyle back under the spotlight after eye-popping verdict","Former President Donald Trump was ordered to pay E. Jean Carroll $83 million in damages for defaming her after he repeatedly denied allegations he raped her in the 1990s, in a legal ordeal that has been mired in controversy and concerns over the former advice columnist's accusations.  ""Absolutely ridiculous! I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party,"" Trump posted on Truth Social shortly after the verdict was read on Friday. ""Our Legal System is out of control, and being used as a Political Weapon. They have taken away all First Amendment Rights."" Carroll, who previously worked as a columnist for Elle Magazine, had filed two lawsuits against Trump since 2019, when she first accused him of raping her in an excerpt in her book ""What Do We Need Men For? A Modest Proposal."" Trump vehemently denied the allegation, saying, ""it never happened,"" ultimately leading Carroll to sue Trump for defamation when he was still president.  Carroll filed a second lawsuit against Trump in 2022, accusing the former president of rape and defamation for social media posts where Trump denied the allegations and accused her of promoting a ""hoax and a lie."" Carroll was able to sue Trump over the rape accusation despite it being past the statute of limitations due to the passage of a law in New York in 2019 that allowed adults to file a one-time civil case despite the expiration of the statute of limitations.  TRUMP CANNOT ASSERT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY IN E JEAN CARROLL DEFAMATION LAWSUIT, APPEALS COURT RULES TRUMP CANNOT ASSERT PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY IN E JEAN CARROLL DEFAMATION LAWSUIT, APPEALS COURT RULES Trump was never criminally charged with sexual assault, as the statute of limitations had expired. Last spring, jurors found Trump liable for sexual abuse – though not rape – and awarded Carroll $5 million in a judgment. The jury said Carroll hadn’t proven that Trump raped her. Carroll’s recently-wrapped case sought more than $10 million for damage to her reputation stemming from Trump’s comments in 2019, when he was still president. The jury ultimately awarded her $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages. Amid the trial, Carroll’s attorney told U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan that Trump was heard remarking that the trial was a ""witch hunt, and it really is a con job."" JUDGE THREATENS TO BAR TRUMP FROM COURTROOM OVER INTERJECTIONS DURING E JEAN CARROLL TRIAL ""Mr. Trump has a right to be present here. That right can be forfeited if he is disruptive and if he disregards court orders,"" Kaplan said before threatening to boot Trump from the trial if he ""can't control"" himself.  Amid court proceedings and immediately following, supporters of the president and social media critics have sounded off with previous remarks Carroll has made that raised concerns about her recounting, including her 2019 interview on CNN where she argued ""most people"" view rape as ""sexy."" ""​​I think most people think of rape as being sexy,"" Carroll told CNN’s Anderson Cooper in 2019, before the anchor cut to a commercial break.  Trump, along with his supporters, have argued his hands were tied amid the trial as the judge barred some evidence from being shown to the jury, including the Cooper interview. Trump said last week that the CNN interview would ""totally"" exonerate him from a ""decades old accusation."" The judge presiding over the case also barred Trump's legal team from arguing he didn’t sexually assault Carroll, or ""that she fabricated her account of the assault, or that she had any motive to do so."" Kaplan ruled that the case would not be a ""do over"" of the case last year when Trump was found liable for sexual abuse, but not criminally charged with sexual assault. LAWYER IN TRUMP DEFAMATION CASE WON'T INTRODUCE 'ACCESS HOLLYWOOD' TAPE AHEAD OF POSSIBLE TESTIMONY ""Donald Trump is not allowed to call his accuser E Jean Carroll a nut job. So we can do it for him,"" one X user posted this month, accompanied by a 2017 interview between Carroll and Elle Magazine. In the interview, Carroll showed off her cabin home, called the ""Mouse House,"" as well as rocks she had painted blue, and a shed decked out with names of books and authors who influenced her in her youth.  Carroll also came under fire for tweets about learning ""sex tips"" from her dog, as well as for naming her cat ""Vagina T. Fireball,"" according to a 2019 Vanity Fair article, and one of her dogs ""Tits,"" according to the 2017 video interview with Elle Magazine.  Carroll said in her memoir that in 1995 or 1996, she saw Trump in a Bergdorf Goodman store in Manhattan, where she claims the two exchanged shopping banter before he attacked her in a dressing room in the store’s lingerie department. The year of the incident was later clarified to the spring of 1996. The department store previously confirmed it had no surveillance footage to prove or disprove the attack, New York magazine previously reported.  Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday that Carroll allegedly changed the timeline of her recounting of the incident due to previously claiming that she still had the Donna Karan dress she wore the day of the attack, though the dress had not yet been manufactured.  ""E. Jean Carroll was forced to change her story about her ‘dress’ when Donna Karan, the designer of the dress, said that it wasn’t conceived or manufactured until long after the date in question. In other words, the Monica Lewinsky type gambit failed badly, then also learning that there was ZERO EVIDENCE on the dress, despite all of the threats. All of this HOAX run and funded by Political Operatives!!!"" Trump wrote.  TRUMP VIDEO OF E JEAN CARROLL DEPOSITION RELEASED: ‘SHE WOULDN’T BE MY TYPE IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM' Trump also highlighted on his Truth Social account that Carroll described the encounter as a ""fight,"" and she had ""not been raped."" ""Every woman gets to choose her word. Every woman gets to choose how she describes it. This is my way of saying it. This is my word. My word is ‘fight,'"" she explained in an interview with a New York Times podcast in 2019. ""My word is not the victim word. I have not – I have not been raped,"" she continued. ""I have – something has not been done to me. I fought. That’s the thing."" Trump said on Truth Social last week that Carroll's accusations were ""false"" and ""forced into the public eye by Democrat operatives like her lawyer, her finders, and others.""  During last year’s trial, Trump’s legal team and critics drew parallels between Carroll’s allegations and an episode of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,"" which included a plot line where a character discussed role-playing a rape fantasy in Bergdorf Goodman. Carroll said during last year’s trial that she was ""aware"" of the 2012 episode, but had not seen it. Trump has repeatedly denied Carroll's accusations, including in the White House when he was president, which is a central argument to Carroll’s case. ""He had the biggest microphone on the planet… He used it to tear her reputation to shreds – to defame her,"" Shawn Crowley, one of Carroll’s attorneys, said earlier this month.  ""Is it any wonder that when Donald Trump spoke from the White House, people all across the country listened and many, many believed what he said? Of course not,"" Crowley added.  Carroll also told the jury this month that due to Trump’s public comments in 2019 regarding the accusations, her life has been threatened and she’s been painted as a ""whack job.""  ""I spent 50 years building a reputation,"" Carroll said last week. ""Now I'm known as a liar, a fraud, and a whack job."" Following the verdict, Carroll said she plans to do ""something good"" with the funds awarded to her from the case. Trump, who received support from New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik ahead of the verdict, said court proceedings were ""witch hunts,"" and his legal team is now working to appeal the verdict. The legal team reportedly plans to use a ""conflict of interest"" between Carroll’s attorney and Kaplan to appeal the case, the New York Post reported.  ""President Trump is leading in the polls, and now we see what you get in New York,"" Trump attorney Alina Habba told reporters following the verdict. ""It will not deter us, we will keep fighting, and I assure you we didn't win today, but we will win.""","2024-01-28 21:34:41","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/e-jean-carrolls-claims-against-trump-lifestyle-back-under-spotlight-eye-popping-verdict","Terrorism/Protest/Political Unrest/Riot"

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/george-soros-pours-millions-texas-shifting-power-dems","George Soros pours millions into Texas in hopes of shifting power to Dems","Liberal billionaire George Soros is pouring extensive amounts of cash into Texas in an attempt to flip the state to Democrats, state campaign finance records reviewed by Fox News Digital show. Soros has contributed over $3 million to at least five left-wing groups in the Lone Star State over the last year to beef up infrastructure and help Democrats make gains in the overwhelmingly Republican stronghold. The financier is single-handedly propelling one of the progressive groups working to accomplish those goals.  Fox News Digital reported in August that Texas Majority PAC, a mysterious under-the-radar group positioning itself to turn the state blue, had received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Soros' Democracy PAC II. SOROS PUSHED $15M TO NONPROFIT LINKED TO BIDEN SUPER PAC TO TEST 'CRITICAL' POLICY ISSUES, TAX DOCS REVEAL Texas Majority PAC had not been publicly launched, nor were there any news reports about it at the time. However, it has since come out of the shadows and into the spotlight.  A recent report by The Texas Tribune said former staffers from Democrat Beto O'Rourke's failed gubernatorial campaign operate the group, and it raised nearly $2.25 million last year.  BIDEN'S RE-ELECTION EFFORTS BOLSTERED BY MASSIVE DONATIONS FROM GEORGE SOROS AND OTHER BILLIONAIRES ""We need millions of more dollars and hundreds of more full-time staff to do this,"" the group's executive director, Katherine Fischer, told The Texas Tribune last week regarding its fundraising. ""Texas Majority PAC works with partners across the state to create the conditions that will make flipping the state possible."" Recently released Texas campaign finance records reviewed by Fox News Digital show Soros has provided all its donations to date. His Democracy PAC II has given the group $850,000 in contributions, while he has personally provided $1.4 million. They account for the PAC's entire $2.25 million in donations. Mayra Flores, a former Republican congresswoman and the first Mexican-born woman to serve in the House of Representatives, believes Soros is pouring money into the Texas Majority PAC to boost Democrat turnout in 2024 because he doesn't want Republican Hispanic leaders like her to win over other Hispanics who have traditionally voted blue. ""They're seeing that Hispanics are shifting towards the Republican Party because they're realizing that we are the party of prosperity, that we want to build a strong economy, that we want to secure the border, that we want to prioritize the people of this country and not prioritize people from outside this country. And I believe that it's our policies that are winning people over, and the struggle is real,"" Flores recently said.  ALEX SOROS' ACCESS TO BIDEN'S WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES AS HE'S NOW VISITED AT LEAST 20 TIMES, RECORDS SHOW ""George Soros and the Democratic Party are seeing people like myself that resonate with the Hispanic community,"" she added. ""They resonate with me. I resonate with them. We have similar stories. I'm bilingual. I speak Spanish and English. We have similar stories, and we share that bond."" The bulk of Soros' Texas cash has gone to the Texas Majority PAC, but he has also given hundreds of thousands of dollars to other groups working to elect Democrats statewide.

But let's keep in mind, the political elite has gotten nothing done for us,"" Haley said during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""  ""I mean, we know exactly the people that pushed it are his people. And I know that during the debates, I mean, he was pushing Ronna McDaniel to stop the debates. He was calling her every other day. He's been pushing them to pay for his lawsuits and all of these other things. But at the end of the day, this is not about the RNC. This is about the American people.""  As Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., is taking heat from the GOP over a border supplemental package being negotiated with Democrats that conservatives fear could still allow 5,000 illegal border crossings a day, Haley seemed to encourage Lankford and told Republicans not to leave Washington without the bill finished.  HALEY FACES GROWING CALLS TO LEAVE 2024 RACE AS RNC NEARLY CONSIDERS DECLARING TRUMP THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE ""My message to Republicans is do not leave D.C. until you finish the job. We have waited for so long for Congress to do something about the border. First, Joe Biden should be securing the border. This is a national security threat. The idea that he is actually suing Gov. Abbott for trying to protect the people of Texas is wrong.

Republicans say the president could act under current law, but won't.  ""I say to President Biden, prove it. Get into a room and get this done and prove it, because the American people are waiting,"" Haley said Sunday. ""I put this on Republicans and Democrats. I'm not picking favorites in this. I'm telling you, they have all not done a good job from the very beginning, and it is time that we get this country safe again.""  Later in the program, host Kristen Welker asked Haley about law enforcement responding to a swatting incident at her home when Haley's elderly parents were there last month.  LONE HOUSE REPUBLICAN SUPPORTING NIKKI HALEY AFTER NH AND IOWA LOSSES MAKES HER CASE FOR 2024 ""It put my family in danger.

""And so, look, I'm not the only one that's happened to, it wasn't the first time. I think we've had it happen twice. But I will tell you this, that I think that what's really important is we have lived in a country of chaos for quite a while now. It is time that we remember what normal felt like. It is time that we remember what healing feels like. It is time that we remember what it's like not to have division, not to have hate.""  Addressing concerns of political violence on the campaign trail, Haley went on to say she believes America ""hit rock bottom.""  ""I've had threats made. It's what happens when you run for president. I can handle that. That is not the problem. What I don't want is for my kids to live like this,"" Haley said. ""My husband is deployed right now sacrificing for America with his military brothers and sisters.

Mark Green, R-Tenn., accuse Mayorkas of ""Willfull and systemic refusal to comply with the law"" and ""breach of public trust.""  ""Throughout his tenure as Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro N. Mayorkas has repeatedly violated laws enacted by Congress regarding immigration and border security. In large part because of his unlawful conduct, millions of aliens have illegally entered the United States on an annual basis with many unlawfully remaining in the United States. His refusal to obey the law is not only an offense against the separation of powers in the Constitution of the United States, it also threatens our national security,"" Republicans allege in the first article. ""Alejandro N. Mayorkas knowingly made false statements to Congress that the border is 'secure,' that the border is ‘no less secure than it was previously,’ that the border is 'closed,' and that DHS has ‘operational control’ of the border,"" they allege in the second article. 'SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS': MICHAEL MCCAUL SOUNDS ALARM ON BORDER PATROL MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ""These articles lay out a clear, compelling, and irrefutable case for Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ impeachment. He has willfully and systemically refused to comply with immigration laws enacted by Congress. He has breached the public trust by knowingly making false statements to Congress and the American people, and obstructing congressional oversight of his department. These facts are beyond dispute, and the results of his lawless behavior have been disastrous for our country,"" said Green, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. House Speaker Mike Johnson told fellow Republican lawmakers on Friday that he intends to hold a House-wide vote on whether to impeach Mayorkas ""as soon as possible."" WATCH: MIGRANTS CLAIM ASYLUM ON COLD JANUARY NIGHT AS CBP UNION LEADER TALKS BORDER CRISIS Johnson pointed out polling that showed illegal immigration as an increasingly urgent issue for American voters.

""Rather than accept accountability, President Biden is now trying to blame Congress for what HE himself intentionally created."" The Department of Homeland Security offered a response to the allegations on Sunday, arguing that Republicans failed to present evidence that Mayorkas has committed any ""high crimes or misdemeanors."" CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS STRIKE DEAL TO PUNT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN DEADLINES The DHS argues the GOP effort has been a ""cynical and hypocritical process"" that was ""predetermined from the start."" ""This markup is just more of the same political games from House Homeland Security Committee (CHS) Republicans. They don’t want to fix the problem; they want to campaign on it. That’s why they have undermined efforts to achieve bipartisan solutions and ignored the facts, legal scholars and experts, and even the Constitution itself in their quest to baselessly impeach Secretary Mayorkas,"" the DHS said in a memo. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-MS., ranking member of the committee, rejected Republicans' argument in a statement. ""What is glaringly missing from these articles is any real charge or even a shred of evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors – the Constitutional standard for impeachment. That should come as no surprise because Republicans’ so-called ‘investigation’ of Secretary Mayorkas has been a remarkably fact-free affair. They are abusing Congress’ impeachment power to appease their MAGA members, score political points, and deflect Americans’ attention from their do-nothing Congress,"" Thompson said in a statement.

Naperville, an affluent suburb located roughly 30 miles west of Chicago, had considered having residents volunteer to bring migrants into their homes amid concerns that Chicago’s struggles to house migrants may spill over into the suburbs. On Thursday, city staff decided it was not necessary for Naperville residents to sign up as other state and federal agencies were making lists of shelters for migrants in need of housing, WLS-TV reported. Josh McBroom, a city council member, made headlines during a Jan. 16 council meeting discussion about what his city should do if a wave of illegal immigrants arrived in their neighborhood as they have in other neighboring towns. McBroom suggested a sign-up sheet for those willing to open their homes to migrants.

Most, if not all, of those injured and killed were Army soldiers at a base known as Tower 22, which has been in support of the counter-ISIS mission for years, the official said.  The president as well as Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin blamed Iran-backed militias for Sunday's attack. A coalition of Iran-backed militant groups calling themselves the ""Islamic Resistance in Iraq"" claimed responsibility.  Later Sunday, President Biden said the U.S. ""had a tough day in the Middle East,"" and vowed: ""We shall respond.""  The troops’ death marked a major escalation of tensions in the region, after months of strikes by militia groups on American forces in the region in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war.  FATHER OF MURDERED IDF SOLDIER SAYS HAMAS TERRORISTS TRIED TO SELL HIS SON'S HEAD FOR $10,000 President Biden said the United States ""will hold all those responsible to account at a time and in a manner (of) our choosing."" Secretary Austin said he was ""outraged and deeply saddened"" by the fatalities and the injuries.  ""These brave Americans and their families are in my prayers, and the entire Department of Defense mourns their loss,"" he said. ""Iran-backed militias are responsible for these continued attacks on U.S. forces, and we will respond at a time and place of our choosing.""  He added: ""The President and I will not tolerate attacks on American forces, and we will take all necessary actions to defend the United States, our troops, and our interests."" The U.S. military base at al-Tanf in Syria is just 12 miles north of Tower 22. The Jordanian installation provides a critical logistical hub for U.S. forces in Syria, including those at al-Tanf, which is near the intersection of the Iraq, Syria and Jordan borders. Since the war in Gaza began Oct. 7, Iranian-backed militias have struck American military installations in Iraq more than 60 times and in Syria more than 90 times, with a mix of drones, rockets, mortars and ballistic missiles.  Scores of U.S. personnel have been wounded, including some with traumatic brain injuries, during the attacks. The militias have said that their strikes are in retaliation for Washington's support for Israel in the war in Gaza and have also said they aim to push U.S. forces out of the region. The U.S. in recent months has struck targets in Iraq, Syria and Yemen to respond to attacks on American forces in the region and to deter Iran-backed Houthi rebels from continuing to threaten commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

James Lankford, R-Okla., cited the ""presidential election year"" in explaining on Sunday why Republicans are backing away from the border bill he is negotiating with Senate Democrats, arguing that the supplemental package, contrary to the assertion by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is ""not about letting 5,000 people in a day.""  Lankford, under fire from the Oklahoma GOP as well over the border bill, appeared on ""Fox News Sunday,"" where he defended the package said to have something akin to a Title 42 power that would allow everyone at the border to be turned away. Last week, Cruz blasted the Republican compromise, however, saying it still afforded about 6 million people – or two-thirds of the 9.6 million illegal border crossings under President Biden – to illegally enter and stay. He further argued the actual text language of the legislation was being kept a secret.  ""The challenge that Sen. Cruz has and a bunch of other folks is they're still waiting to be able to read the bill on this. And this has been our great challenge of being able to fight through the final words, to be able to get the bill text out so people can hear it. Right now there's internet rumors is all that people are running on. It would be absolutely absurd for me to agree to 5,000 people a day,"" Lankford told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream. ""This bill focuses on getting us to zero illegal crossings a day. There's no amnesty."" Lankford argued the bill increases the number of Border Patrol agents, increases asylum officers, and increases detention beds ""so we can quickly detain and then deport individuals."" SENATE BORDER BILL TO ALLOW 5,000 MIGRANTS A DAY BEFORE TITLE 42-TYPE LIMIT STARTS; SPARKING CONSERVATIVE FURY ""It ends catch and release. It focuses on additional deportation flights out. It changes our asylum process so that people get a fast asylum screening at a higher standard and then get returned back to their home country. This is not about letting 5,000 people in a day,"" he said. ""This is the most misunderstood section of this proposal."" In the past four months, Lankford said, there's only been seven days when less than 5,000 people have crossed the border in one day. ""This is set up for if you have a rush of people coming at the border, the border closes down. No one gets in,"" he said of the bill. ""This is not someone standing at the border with a little clicker saying, I'm going to let one more. And we're at 4,999, and then it has to stop. It is a shutdown of the border and everyone actually gets turned around.""  Despite President Biden claiming at a campaign rally this weekend that the border supplemental would allow him to secure the border, Lankford stressed the Democrat incumbent could already secure the border now if he wanted to. Some Republicans are criticizing Lankford for pursuing the bill anyhow, essentially handing Biden a win to claim he's made progress on the border crisis. But the senator from Oklahoma urged that the timing of the election shouldn't affect progress.  ""Republicans four months ago would not give funding for Ukraine, for Israel and for our southern border because we demanded changes in policy. So we actually locked arms together and said, we're not going to give you money for this. We want a change in law. And now it's interesting, a few months later, when we're finally going to the end, they're like, 'Oh, just kidding. I actually don't want a change in law,'"" Lankford said. ""We all have an oath to the Constitution, and we have a commitment to say we're going to do whatever we can to be able to secure the border."" The Republican senator noted that over the last four months, 50 people on the terror watch list were detected crossing the border.  BORDER DEAL PRICE TAG LIKELY TO COST MORE THAN $14 BILLION, BUT GOP LAWMAKERS GROW RESTLESS TO SEE BILL TEXT Tens of thousands more declared national security risks were detected crossing the border.  ""This puts in mandatory pieces that haven't been there in the past to make this administration actually enforce the law. I would tell you that I don't – I don't know of anyone that believes that if President Trump was elected, he was president right now, this border would not have this problem. So the thought that somehow President Biden can suddenly be the pro-national security president in the final months of this is not believable,"" Lankford continued. ""We've had millions of people illegally cross because he opened up our border. He literally invited the world to be able to come, and they came. That's why we have this chaos. We've got to do something now to be able to stop it, and then to be able to put new tools that even the Trump administration was looking for when they were president, put those tools in place for every president from here on out.""  Later in the program, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., noted mounting criticism from his own party against Lankford.  ""He's on a suicide mission. The Democrats do not want to secure the border,"" Scott said. ""This border could be secure, but we know we have a lawless administration, a completely lawless Biden administration. So the only way this is going to happen is if we have accountability that forces Biden to enforce the law. We could change all these laws. There's laws now. Trump secured the border. Biden decided open the border on the exact same laws. We don't need a new bill. We need something to enforce to force Biden to comply with the law.""  Scott said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Lankford he cannot add accountability measures to the bill to require Biden to secure the border immediately.  ""Biden could do that today. Why doesn't he do it today? I mean, he doesn't need any of this to secure the border. Trump secured the border with the exact same laws,"" Scott said. ""Unless there's some accountability measure that forces Biden to secure the border – tied to Ukraine aid, tied to something else – unless there's something like that, Biden is not going to comply with the law. If it was important for him to comply with the law, he would do it right now. If we can't force Biden to secure the border, we need to shut the border today."" ","2024-01-29 01:12:19","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lankford-cites-election-year-waning-gop-support-border-bill-not-about-letting-5000-people-a-day","Others"

""I don't care that I'm just one. … I don't care if the whole caucus says we ought to end it right now and get out. I'm just not gonna do that."" Norman, a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, came out for Haley early in the race and has remained her only supporter in Congress. A handful of lawmakers had supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis before he dropped out, but the vast majority — more than 120 House Republicans — have so far backed former President Donald Trump. Speaking with Fox News Digital days after Trump’s victory in the New Hampshire primary, Norman insisted the race was far from over.

""And I will say this, being 25 years younger than President Trump, it's gonna take work night and day to unwind the devastation this president has done.""

He said McDaniel was ""out of line"" calling for unity behind Trump. HALEY FACES GROWING CALLS TO LEAVE 2024 RACE AS RNC NEARLY CONSIDERS DECLARING TRUMP THE PRESUMPTIVE NOMINEE ""That’s not her role,"" Norman said. ""How is competition bad? What's the rush?"" He also took a veiled shot at a fellow member of the South Carolina congressional delegation, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who dropped out of the running for president and endorsed Trump. ""It surprised me with Tim Scott, particularly with not even calling her. But it is what it is,"" Norman said. But unlike other Republicans who have been attacked by Trump and his allies for not falling in line fast enough — including fellow Freedom Caucus members — Norman has stayed out of the line of fire. HOUSE VOTES TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AFTER SPEAKER JOHNSON BUCKS GOP REBELS Norman pointed out he’s never criticized Trump and supported his actions in office. He also revealed that he called the ex-president before making his endorsement last February. ""When I supported Nikki Haley, I had the respect of Donald Trump to call him, and I told him what I was gonna do, and I decided I was going to do it,"" he said.  He added that Haley is eligible for eight years, versus Trump, who could only serve one more term.  ""I know what she did South Carolina,"" Norman said. ""I know what she can do to the country, and she can give us eight years."" Norman did, however, push back on Trump declaring that Haley's donors are ""permanently barred from the MAGA camp."" ""I think he's making a mistake, saying that anybody that gives to Nikki is gonna be excluded from MAGA,"" Norman said. ""I think he's gonna need all the votes that it takes, as well as Nikki, any candidate. It's gonna take a lot to beat whoever the Democratic nominee is, so I find it interesting that he's doing that.

The Illinois State Officers Electoral Board is expected to consider the recommendation on Tuesday.  Erickson's 21-page recommendation concluded that a ""preponderance of the evidence"" presented proves that Trump engaged in insurrection. HALEY BLASTS RNC FOR RUSHING TO TRUMP AS NOMINEE, CALLS ON AMERICANS TO ‘REMEMBER WHAT NORMAL FELT LIKE’ But he said the election board can't engage in the ""significant and sophisticated constitutional analysis"" required to remove Trump's name before the March 19 primary. He said the decision should ultimately be left to the courts. He likened the board's attempt to resolve the constitutional question to ""scheduling a two-minute round between heavyweight boxers in a telephone booth.""  Still, Erickson noted that even if the board disagrees with his reasoning, Trump's name should be removed from the Illinois primary ballot. Free Speech for People, which is leading the Illinois ballot effort, praised Erickson’s recommendation as ""significant"" but argued that Illinois law allows the board to make the ballot decision. ""We expect that the board and ultimately Illinois courts will uphold Judge Erickson's thoughtful analysis of why Trump is disqualified from office, but — with the greatest respect — correct him on why Illinois law authorizes that ruling,"" Ron Fein, legal director for the group, wrote in a Sunday statement. The Illinois saga echoes similar efforts in several other states. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments next month in a historic Colorado Supreme Court ruling to remove Trump from that state's ballot.  The case presents the high court with its first look at a provision of the 14th Amendment barring some people who ""engaged in insurrection"" from holding public office.

Biden was pictured during a visit to union workers in Wisconsin alongside Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn. The photo clearly shows Biden wearing the hard hat backwards, with the strap and tightening knob clearly visible. Snopes' initial fact check, published Friday, attempted to explain the appearance. ""The photo is genuine. And it does look, at first glance, like Biden was wearing that hard hat backwards. But after comparing it to other photos and videos of the same event, we were forced to reach the opposite conclusion: The hat on Biden's head was facing forward, bill to the front, not backward,"" Snopes claimed. DOZENS OF SENATE REPUBLICANS WARN BIDEN'S LATEST WAR ON ENERGY EMPOWERS AMERICA'S ENEMIES Social media users blasted the determination, however, as hard hats universally have the tightening strap on the back. After weathering a storm on social media, Snopes offered an update reversing the fact check. ""The prevailing counter-argument is that if the suspension of the hat has been purposely configured by its owner such that the bill and tightening knob are worn to the back (as was the case of the hat Biden wore), to wear that hat with the bill facing forward is, practically speaking, to wear it backwards. Therefore, it's argued, it's actually true that, in the photo op discussed below, Biden was wearing it backwards.

The Department of Homeland Security had written to Attorney General Ken Paxton this week seeking ""full access to the Shelby Park area currently obstructed by Texas"" after Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration had taken control of it earlier this month. DHS has repeatedly sought access to the area, and in response last week Texas said it will allow entry to any Border Patrol personnel responding to an emergency. In response, DHS said it wants unrestricted access during emergencies, as well as regular access to the port of entry, the boat ramp and border barrier entrances. BORDER PATROL HAS ‘NO PLANS’ TO REMOVE RAZOR WIRE SET UP BY TEXAS AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN  The letter also identified parts of the area where it claimed to have acquired real estate interests and therefore should be able to access them. ""Because the Department owns property rights to the areas depicted on the attached map, we demand that you immediately remove any and all obstructions on it, . . ."" the letter said. Paxton, in response to that letter, dismissed the legal basis for the demand. He disputes the claim that the federal government has rights over the areas claimed by the administration. ""With respect to parcels identified in your maps that are actually in the vicinity of the park, publicly available records suggest the United States does not even purport to own what your latest letter claims,"" he wrote in a Friday letter. He went on to request that the agency supply maps and deeds showing the areas it claims the U.S. government owns and how officials are blocking access to them. He also dismisses claims by the administration that it needs access to the area to patrol the border. ""But you (unsurprisingly) omit the statutory language that your agency continues publicly to disregard: Border Patrol is tasked with ‘patrolling the border to prevent the illegal entry of aliens,’"" he said. ""As I said before, this office will continue to defend Texas’s efforts to protect its southern border against every effort by the Biden Administration to undermine the State’s constitutional right of self-defense. You should advise your clients to join us in those efforts by doing their job and following the law,"" he said. The letter comes as part of a multi-faceted standoff between the two sides when it comes to how to deal with the ongoing border crisis. The Supreme Court this week sided with the administration when it granted an emergency appeal to allow agents to keep cutting border wire set up by Texas after a lower court had blocked such moves. However, Border Patrol currently has ""no plans"" to remove the wire unless in an emergency, a senior CBP official told Fox on Friday. ABBOTT DECLARES TEXAS HAS ‘RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE’ FROM MIGRANT ‘INVASION’ AMID FEUD WITH BIDEN ADMIN The Biden administration has also sued over the Texas law, recently signed by Abbott, that allows state and local law enforcement to arrest illegal immigrants. There has been another legal feud over the establishment of buoys by Texas in the Rio Grande. Abbott has said Texas has a right to ""self-defense"" against what he says is federal inaction about a migrant ""invasion."" ""[President Biden's] actions have caused an unprecedented invasion that we must defend against,"" Abbott said on Thursday. The Biden administration has said that Texas is interfering with the federal enforcement of immigration law. ""Enforcement of immigration law is a federal responsibility,"" a DHS spokesperson said this week. ""Rather than helping to reduce irregular migration, the State of Texas has only made it harder for frontline personnel to do their jobs and to apply consequences under the law.

Michael McCaul reminded Americans that former President Donald Trump cut funding to the U.N. agency during his administration.  ""The United Nations Relief Agency, the previous Trump administration, cut all funding for a reason, just for this reason. The idea that UNRWA was actually supplying, you know, harboring weapons to assist with Hamas' invasion of Israel,"" McCaul told Fox News’ Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday.""  ""Now, those are the allegations that have come out of Israel, we're investigating, but if true, think how outrageous that is,"" he continued.  As of Saturday, the U.S., United Kingdom and other key Western powers cut funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which is intended to provide relief and humanitarian services to Palestinian refugees, following accusations that 12 staffers with the group were ""involved"" in the October attack on Israel. MORE COUNTRIES CUT FUNDING TO UN AGENCY AFTER STAFFERS ACCUSED OF PARTICIPATING IN OCT. 7 HAMAS ATTACK Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has since praised the U.S. decision as ""an important step in holding UNRWA accountable.""  The State Department under Trump cut ties with UNRWA in 2018, but President Biden resumed funding to the group shortly after taking office. He continued to increase spending to the organization, with funds exceeding $1 billion, Fox News Digital previously reported.  Trump said in 2018 that he pulled funding to the group after peace talks stalled.  ""I stopped massive amounts of money that we were paying to the Palestinians and the Palestinian leaders. We were – the United States was paying them tremendous amounts of money,"" Trump said at the time. ""And I'd say, 'You'll get money, but we're not paying you until we make a deal.

The comment sparked outrage from Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Gilad Erdan, who said nations that continue funding the UNWRA ""before a comprehensive investigation of the organization should know that its money might be used for terrorism.""  ""The U.N. secretary-general has proven once again that the security of the citizens of Israel is not really important for him. After years in which he ignored the evidence presented to him personally about UNRWA's support and involvement in incitement and terrorism, and before he conducted a comprehensive investigation to locate all Hamas terrorists in UNRWA, he called to fund an organization that is deeply contaminated with terrorism,"" Erdan said.  KIRBY UNSURE OF ‘DOLLAR FIGURE’ OF US FUNDING TO CONTROVERSIAL UN AGENCY ALLEGEDLY TIED TO HAMAS ATTACK McCaul, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently requested the UNRWA commissioner-general appear before the committee on the matter, with the Texas lawmaker saying Sunday, ""We’re gonna get some answers.""

Kristi Noem, who encouraged Republicans to unite in support of the entrepreneur and ""America-first conservative"" in the GOP primary race that still also includes Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state Sen. Matt Dolan.  ""I am pleased to announce my endorsement of Bernie Moreno for the United States Senate. Bernie is a winner and the kind of candidate that we need to win this November to take back the Senate,"" Noem said in a statement on Thursday. ""I’ve known Bernie for over 10 years, and I’ve always been impressed by his conservative values and by his ability to get things done. Those are two qualities that we desperately need in the U.S. Senate."" ""Ohio deserves better than the radical liberal views of career politician Sherrod Brown. He’ll be tough to beat, so it’s crucial that we unite behind Bernie now,"" she added.  OHIO REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATES CLASH OVER BORDER SECURITY, DRONE STRIKES IN MEXICO Early voting starts on Feb. 2 in the Ohio Republican primary scheduled for March 19.  A nod to Moreno's growing strength in the primary contest, Brown has begun targeting Moreno, deeming him ""Trump’s hand-picked candidate."" Brown, one of two Democratic incumbents up for reelection this year in the state Trump won in 2016 and 2020, is considered a key target for Republicans hoping to reclaim the Senate majority in November, The Hill noted.  Moreno – who was endorsed by former President Trump in December – clashed with LaRose and Dolan on the border issue during last week's Republican primary debate, and the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm notably has not yet prioritized funding for one of the three primary candidates as the strongest to go up against Brown.  VULNERABLE DEM SENATOR PROMOTES TIKTOK ACCOUNT AFTER SAYING HE HAD ‘SERIOUS CONCERNS’ ABOUT CCP TIES At an event for the conservative-leaning think tank The Ripon Society last week, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said a GOP victory against Brown cannot be taken for granted because the incumbent Democrat has demonstrated he knows ""how to win"" in a red-leaning state. ""But we think that Matt Dolan, Bernie Moreno and Frank LaRose are all capable of beating Sherrod Brown,"" Daines said. ""We will have a primary … in March, and we’ll be off to the general election."" After Trump threw his support behind him, Moreno has picked up other key endorsements from Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., yet GOP strategists who spoke with The Hill said Moreno should not consider the nomination yet in the bag and must spend some of his own money to effectively communicate those endorsements to Ohio voters.  His competitors have enjoyed more name recognition, given LaRose holds statewide office and Dolan, who has served in the state Senate since 2017, unsuccessfully ran in the primary for Sen. JD Vance’s seat in 2022 and was the first to enter the race to challenge Brown.","2024-01-28 17:50:24","https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-ally-moreno-picks-noem-endorsement-rises-top-ohio-republican-vying-boot-democrat-sherrod-brown","Others"

On Friday, Biden announced that he would ""shut down the border"" once Congress passes a bipartisan immigration deal that would purportedly give the president authority to do so. In a press release, Biden acknowledged that ""the border's been broken."" ""What’s been negotiated would — if passed into law — be the toughest and fairest set of reforms to secure the border we’ve ever had in our country,"" the president said. ""It would give me, as president, a new emergency authority to shut down the border when it becomes overwhelmed. And if given that authority, I would use it the day I sign the bill into law.""

"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-energy-secretary-republicans-blast-biden-for-bowing-to-elite-environmental-lobby","Trump energy secretary, Republicans blast Biden for bowing to 'elite environmental lobby'","A wide range of Republicans, including former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, excoriated President Biden for his decision to pause proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects over its economic impacts and potential to boost U.S. enemies. Perry and Republican lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., House Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., and House Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., argued LNG exports were critical for maintaining low energy prices in the U.S., supporting American allies are able to wean off Russian gas and decrease global carbon emissions. ""It is an act of economic hostility to withhold U.S. LNG supply from the allies we have promised it to, particularly in the midst of ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Europe,"" Perry said in a statement. ""The Biden moratorium on LNG permits will empower Putin while killing jobs in Pennsylvania. It will hamstring American national security by forcing our allies back to Russia and Qatar for their energy supply."" ""It will also result in an increase in emissions by withholding the most effective tool we have to improve the climate,"" he continued. ""It is a grave mistake for President Biden to reverse course and bow to the elite environmental lobby who do not represent the best interests of the American people and our allies overseas."" DOZENS OF SENATE REPUBLICANS WARN BIDEN'S LATEST WAR ON ENERGY EMPOWERS AMERICA'S ENEMIES Perry — who led the Department of Energy (DOE) under the Trump administration between March 2017 and December 2019 — added that, while serving as secretary of energy, he met with dozens of European leaders who were ""hungry to diversify their energy suppliers."" On Friday morning, Biden ordered the DOE to pause pending permits for LNG export facilities while federal officials conduct a rigorous environmental review assessing the projects' carbon emissions, which could take more than a year to complete. The move represents a major victory for climate activists who have loudly called for such a move, even threatening to hold large protests in Washington, D.C., over the issue. BIDEN ADMIN APPEARS TO FABRICATE PAPER TRAIL IN PURSUIT OF MAJOR CHEMICAL PLANT SHUTDOWN: COURT DOCS In a statement Friday, the president said the pause on LNG permitting was a part of his sweeping climate agenda, saying the action ""sees the climate crisis for what it is: the existential threat of our time."" He also took aim at ""MAGA Republicans"" for willfully denying the ""urgency of the climate crisis."" ""President Biden’s decision to indefinitely pause LNG export permits prioritizes the wishes of radical activists over U.S. energy security and the security of our allies,"" said McMorris Rodgers. ""This is another gift to Putin. Everyday Americans want our energy unleashed to strengthen the economy, safeguard jobs, and keep us secure. That’s what Republicans will continue to fight for."" ""It is outrageous that this administration is asking American taxpayers to spend billions to defeat Russia while knowingly forcing allies to rely on Russian energy, giving Putin an advantage,"" added Johnson. ""This policy change also flies in the face of the commitments made when the White House announced the joint US-EU Task Force less than two years ago to reduce Europe’s dependence on Russia and strengthen energy security."" ENVIRONMENTALISTS CALL ON BIDEN ADMIN TO TANK NATURAL GAS PROJECT AMID NATIONWIDE ARCTIC BLAST While it is unclear which proposed projects the action will affect, a senior administration official said at least two have a larger capacity and two have a smaller capacity. Another official added that the pause implemented Friday will only impact projects that have gone through the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) lengthy approval process and are ripe for DOE approval. According to federal data updated this week, there are 11 projects that have been green-lit by FERC but are not yet under construction. An additional four projects are pending before FERC and two are in the pre-filing stage. Those six projects wouldn't be impacted by the pause since they are not before DOE yet, but they would be impacted if approved by FERC. ""Stopping the export of American natural gas is a win for our adversaries, like China and Russia, and a direct blow to the environment, American energy workers and communities as well as our allies overseas,"" Westerman said on Friday. ""It’s a policy that is shortsighted political pandering and will do nothing but drive the cost of energy even higher,"" the Natural Resources Committee chair said. ""American natural gas is the cleanest and safest on earth, and bending the knee to foreign producers only serves to jeopardize our national security and punish hardworking American families who are already struggling under the failing policies of this administration."" BIDEN ADMIN ABRUPTLY REVERSES PROPOSAL OPENING PUBLIC LANDS TO FOREIGN OWNERSHIP AFTER GOP OPPOSITION Congressional Western Caucus Chairman Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said the pause on LNG export terminal permits is ""yet another assault on American energy production that jeopardizes our national security and global energy markets."" ""President Biden’s move to stall LNG exports is only a win for our adversaries and dirty global polluters like China and Russia,"" GOP House Energy Action Team Chair Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, and Republican Study Committee Chairman Kevin Hern, R-Okla., added in a joint statement. ""U.S. LNG helped Europe through a potential energy catastrophe following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and we must not underestimate the important role US LNG cargoes played in handicapping Putin’s efforts."" Biden's action comes weeks after European and Asian energy suppliers called for him to expedite LNG exports. They also called for the president to keep his promise to ensure a steady supply of natural gas in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine. HOUSE REPUBLICANS UNVEIL EFFORT TO BLOCK BIDEN ADMIN FROM TEARING DOWN KEY HYDRO DAMS In the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Biden traveled to Europe and struck a deal with the European Union, vowing to send more U.S. LNG to the bloc. At the time, the White House pledged to ""maintain its regulatory environment,"" a statement that appears to have been contravened with Friday's actions. Additionally, a group of 25 Senate Republicans, led by Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., penned a letter to Biden and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm warning of the consequences of the administration's actions. ""Limiting U.S. LNG exports does not have any impact on the world’s demand for natural gas,"" the letter stated. ""Instead, countries including Russia and Iran will simply produce more energy that is subject to less stringent environmental regulations. As a result, limiting American LNG exports in the name of stopping climate change could do just the opposite and add to global emissions."" Proponents of increased LNG exports have noted that transitioning the world's economy to more natural gas reliance would also help ensure nations meet decarbonization goals. Without increased LNG, they argue, nations would rely more heavily on coal-fired power generation, which has a much larger carbon footprint when burned than natural gas power generation. According to the fossil fuel industry, the U.S. has led the world in carbon emissions reductions thanks in large part to greater reliance on natural gas. Coal produced the largest share of electricity generated in the U.S. for decades until 2015, when natural gas surpassed it. ""Once again, President Biden has caved to far-left extremists, choosing politics over the actual climate science, gutting the American workforce, and putting America’s national security and our allies at risk,"" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said. ""When America exports clean-burning natural gas, global emissions go down and our allies can get off Russian gas.

""Trump operatives expressed an interest in Kennedy early on, but it was all premature,"" one person familiar with the matter told the outlet, adding that it was ""right out of the box when Bobby announced"" in April 2023 that he was making a run for the White House.

""NO ONE from the Trump Campaign ever approached RFK jr (or ever will) - one of the most LIBERAL and radical environmentalists in the country,"" LaCivita wrote in a tweet. Kennedy, 70, initially launched a bid for president last year as a Democrat. However, amid conflicts with the Democratic National Committee tossing its total support behind President Biden in the 2024 race, he announced in October that he would instead be making an independent run for the White House. One large donor to both the Trump and Kennedy campaigns told the outlet that the effort to recruit Kennedy to serve as Trump's running mate is still very much alive amid Trump insiders. ""It’s very much behind the scenes at this stage. As we progress you might see it bubble up a little bit more,"" the donor said. ""Bobby can bring new people to the polls."" Fox News Digital reached out to Trump's and Kennedy's campaigns but did not immediately receive a response. Earlier this week, both Trump and RFK came down on the same side of the ongoing southern border crisis in Texas. Kennedy said Texas was ""right"" to defend its borders amid what he regarded as the failed policies of the Biden administration. VOTERS SHARE TOP RUNNING MATE CHOICES FOR TRUMP IF ELECTED: 'IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE YOUNGER' ""A country without borders is not a country at all,"" he wrote in a post to X. Trump said that all Americans ought to support Texas’ ""commonsense measures"" and vowed to work with Lone Star State Gov.

There has been speculation in recent weeks about whom the former president would select as his running mate. Earlier this month, Trump remarked that he knew who his running mate is ""going to be"" during an Iowa Town Hall event put on by Fox News. ""I can't tell you that really, I mean, I know who it's going to be,"" Trump said when he was asked who his running mate will be in 2024. It's unclear who that selection would be, and few in his political orbit appear to have a good feel for whom Trump is leaning toward as his running mate.

The jury decided Trump must pay $18.3 million in compensatory damages and $65 million in punitive damages. The jury's verdict was announced Friday evening by federal Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. A federal jury in New York City decided last year Trump was not liable for rape but was liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The former president was ordered to pay $5 million in that trial. ""Absolutely ridiculous! I fully disagree with both verdicts, and will be appealing this whole Biden Directed Witch Hunt focused on me and the Republican Party,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social shortly after the verdict was read.

""Democrats know they can’t beat Trump on November 5, 2024. So they just want to impeach him twice, throw him in prison for life, bankrupt him, illegally gag him, and simply take him off the ballot. Unless judges want the courts to lose all legitimacy, this must stop."" Conservative commentator and podcast host Benny Johnson also weighed in on the verdict. ""Another example of how the government has been weaponized against Donald Trump in [an] attempt to ruin the man,' Johnson wrote on X. OutKick founder Clay Travis also spoke out against the jury's decision ordering Trump to pay Carroll. ""A left-wing NYC jury just awarded E. Jean Carroll $83 million dollars because they said Trump defamed her by denying he sexually assaulted her,"" Travis stated. ""So, now it’s defamation to claim you didn’t commit a crime? Banana republic we live in, y’all. Total banana republic."" TRUMP DEFENDS HIMSELF ON THE STAND, BLASTS E JEAN CARROLL TRIAL: 'THIS IS NOT AMERICA' ""Legit question, as a matter of law, how can you defend yourself against an accusation that you committed a crime if saying you didn’t commit the crime and the other person is lying about it is defamation? Under this judgement, Trump isn’t legally permitted to defend himself,"" Travis added in a separate post. Though several people took issue with the jury's findings, others celebrated the verdict, including Republican presidential candidate and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. ""Donald Trump wants to be the presumptive Republican nominee and we’re talking about $83.3 million in damages,"" Haley wrote on X. ""We’re not talking about fixing the border. We’re not talking about tackling inflation. America can do better than Donald Trump and Joe Biden."" Responding to Haley, Texas GOP Rep. Lance Gooden wrote on X, ""It’s important to remember that Nikki Haley mega donor, Reid Hoffman, funded E Jean Carroll’s frivolous lawsuit against President Trump. Nikki should return his money and drop out of the race!"" Carroll also celebrated the ruling, saying in a statement that the jury's verdict was a ""great victory"" for women who decide to come forward with claims. ""This is a great victory for every woman who stands up when she’s been knocked down and a huge defeat for every bully who has tried to keep a woman down,"" she said. ""This win is because of Robbie Kaplan and her dazzling team at Kaplan Hecker & Fink."" Despite concerns from Trump's legal team about how the court process played out, Kaplan noted in a statement that the verdict proves the ""law applies to everyone."" ""Today’s verdict proves that the law applies to everyone in our country, even the rich, even the famous, even former presidents,"" Kaplan said. ""There is a way to stand up to someone like Donald Trump who cares more about wealth, fame and power than respecting the law. Standing up to a bully takes courage and bravery; it takes someone like E. Jean Carroll. We thank the jury for standing up for E. Jean and the rule of law."" Trump, the 2024 GOP frontrunner, has repeatedly and vehemently denied the allegation. His denial resulted in Carroll slapping Trump with a defamation lawsuit, claiming that his response caused harm to her reputation. The jury found Carroll was injured as a result of statements Trump made while in the White House in June 2019. The jury awarded Carroll $18.3 million in compensatory damages. The jury found Trump’s statements were made to harm Carroll and awarded her $65 million in punitive damages. In total, the jury said Carroll should be paid $83.3 million.
